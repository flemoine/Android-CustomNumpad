Android-CustomNumpad
====================

Custom Numpad based on Android KeyboardView

This is a simple application which helps people create their own Keyboard. My necessity is to create a Numpad, so this with be a launchpad for that. 

Please change heights and widths in keyboard.xml to change the dimensions and keys.

Change the heights and widths layout/main.xml to change the dimension of the entire keyboard size.
